### Note

Code compilation on a VM is a slow process and can take a few hours. Qualcomm
recommends using an Ubuntu host computer for compilation. To set up a virtual
machine (VM) running Ubuntu 22.04 on Microsoft® Windows® or Apple® macOS®,
see Qualcomm Linux Virtual Machine Setup Guide.

## Build Instructions

1. Download Qualcomm Yocto and the supporting meta-layers.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-releases.git -b <meta-qcom-releases-tag>
    kas checkout meta-qcom-releases/lock.yml
    ```

2. Copy the kas lock file from meta-qcom-releases to meta-qcom. Make sure to
run this step, otherwise the checked out meta layers may get updated to a
newer commit.

    ```bash
    # kas configuration files need to be part of same repository
    # copy kas lock file to meta-qcom repository
    cp meta-qcom-releases/lock.yml meta-qcom/ci/lock.yml
    ```

3. Build the software image. Build targets are defined based on machine and distro
combinations.

    ```bash
    kas build meta-qcom/ci/<machine.yml>:meta-qcom/ci/<distro.yml>:meta-qcom/ci/lock.yml
    ```

4. After a successful build, check that the rootfs.img file is in the build
artifacts:

    ```bash
    cd <workspace-dir>/build/tmp/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/<IMAGE>-<MACHINE>.rootfs.qcomflash/
    ls -al rootfs.img
    ```
